#### Biography
I am currently a junior Undergraduate Student pursuing a bachelor's Degree in computer science at College of Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota Twins Cities.

My research interests lie in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and their application in diverse practical scenarios, such as biological and system large models. My focus also extends to developing efficient machine learning systems aimed at expediting the training and inference processing of LMMs (especially LLMs), leveraging expertise in high-performance computing and distributed systems.

Before transferring to the University of Minnesota, I studied at Nanchang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence in a top-tier class with a School Academic Special Scholarship. I was honored to be advised by Professor [Zichen Xu](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/Pages/Professor.html) at [GOOD LAB](https://good.ncu.edu.cn) starting from March 2022, where my focus was on solving data-centric challenges and building efficient and reliable systems. I was the leader of Nanchang University Supercomputer Cluster Team ([NCUSCC](https://hpc.ncuscc.tech/)) Leader, with experience of ASC22 and SC23(IndySCC).

I was also fortunately recruited as a research assistant at **TOP** NLP Lab [TsinghuaNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) in Beijing from July to September 2023, advised by Professor [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), trying to build efficient distributed large language model training framework [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain) and Develop 10B Chinese LLM [CPM-Bee](https://github.com/OpenBMB/CPM-Bee/blob/main/README_en.md).

I am passionate about open source and firmly believe in its potential to disseminate knowledge widely, leverage technology to lead innovation to the world and contribute to the advancement of human society. I am proud to have garnered over **1000 stars** and acquired **155 followers** on GitHub. It is gratifying to know that my open-source projects have benefitted numerous individuals, and I have personally gained valuable knowledge from the open-source community.
